Create forms with multiple input fields and have your users pay before submission. Form submission results are available on your dashboard.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can create forms with multiple input fields and have your users pay before submission. It also works with recurring payments.

= Forms with recurring payments =

To create a form so your users can make recurring payments for a standard fee.

*  Create your plan on the [official paystack dashboard](https://dashboard.paystack.com)
*  Copy the plan code and paste it on the form plan code settings

= For Churches and NGO's =

Setting the form payment amount to '0' allows the user to make a custom payment of any amount.

When you set the 'recur' option to 'optional' on the form settings, your donors/members will have the option of making a one-time payment or weekly,monthly or annually recurring payment.

This can come in handy for weekly/monthly offerings & tithes or recurring donor donations.

= For selling items =

To create a form to allow your users buy or pay for value in quantity.

*  Set quantified to be 'yes'.
*  Set the max quantity a user can buy.

= Plugin Features =

*   __Accept payment__ via MasterCard and Visa Cards.
*   __Seamless integration__ into any WordPress page or post. Accept subscription payments directly on your site
